There is a long history of testing in this area, and it is clearly one of the most investigated areas in finance.
Almost all of the testing I am aware of involves using realized returns as a proxy for expected returns. The use of average realized returns as a proxy for expected returns relies on a belief that information surprises tend to cancel out over the period of a study and realized returns are therefore an unbiased estimate of expected returns. However, I believe that there is ample evidence that this belief is misplaced. There are periods longer than 10 years during which stock market realized returns are on average less than the risk‐free rate (1973 to 1984). There are periods longer than 50 years in which risky long‐term bonds on average underperform the risk free rate (1927 to 1981).1

Having a risky asset with an expected return above the riskless rate is an extremely weak condition for realized returns to be an appropriate proxy for expected returns, and 11 and 50 years is an awfully long time for such a weak condition not to be satisfied. In the recent past, the United States has had stock market returns of higher than 30 percent per year while Asian markets have had negative returns. Does anyone honestly believe that this is because this was the riskiest period in history for the United States and the safest for Asia? Furthermore, there is a large body of evidence we find anomalous. This includes the effect of inflation on asset pricing and the failure of the generalized expectation theory to explain term premiums. Changing risk premiums and conditional asset pricing theories may be a way of “explaining” some of the anomalous results; however, this does not explain returns on risky assets that are less than the riskless rate for the long periods when it has occurred.
It seems to me that the more logical explanation for these anomalous results is that realized returns are a very poor measure of expected returns and that information surprises highly influence a number of factors in our asset pricing model. I believe that developing better measures of expected return and alternative ways of testing asset pricing theories that do not require using realized returns have a much higher payoff than any additional development of statistical tests that continue to rely on realized returns as a proxy for expected returns. I illustrate what I have in mind by examining the expected return on Government bonds, then I present some preliminary thoughts in the common stock area.
Government bonds are assets for which I believe we can obtain much better estimates of expected return from realized return. Government bonds have little asset‐specific information that should affect their price.2

Rather, the factors that affect the prices of Government bonds are in the form of aggregate economic information. There is wide consensus on which economic variables could affect the prices of Government bonds. Variables that are considered potentially important are common across the major players.3

Furthermore, the time when information about these variables is announced is known and fixed. Finally, the impact of the surprise component in announcements is rapidly incorporated into prices (see Balduzzi et al. (1997)). The combination of a common information set, known announcement time, and rapid reflection of information into price allows us to put together a data set unaffected by information surprises, and provides a unique opportunity to put together a set of reasonably accurate estimates of expected returns. This data set can then be used to examine some of the hypotheses about what affects expected return on Government bonds. In the first part, I explore some of these ideas. In the second part, I make more speculative comments in the common stock area. Before doing either, however, I would like to expand on my prior thoughts briefly.",1604.txt,"we can reject the hypothesis that the constrained model is not different from the unconstrained.

We use a sample of 158 closed‐end funds to show that noise‐trader sentiment, as proxied by retail‐investor flows, leads to fluctuations in the discount. Nevertheless, we reject the hypothesis that noise‐trader risk is the cause of the long‐run discount. Instead we find that funds which are more difficult to arbitrage have larger discounts, due to: (1) the censoring of the discount by the arbitrage bounds, and (2) the freedom of managers to increase charges when arbitrage is costly.",1900.txt,"We hypothesize that the discount and retail flows are codetermined. While retail flows may affect the discount, it may also be the case that a small (or negative) discount attracts flows.",2

Consistent with the previous section, we hypothesize that the discount depends on the flow of investment from small shareholders. To test this hypothesis",6

This paper tests whether policy changes fostering competition and consolidation in U.S. banking helped or harmed entrepreneurs. We find that the rate of new incorporations increases following deregulation of branching restrictions, and that deregulation reduces the negative effect of concentration on new incorporations. We also find the formation of new incorporations increases as the share of small banks decreases, suggesting that diversification benefits of size outweigh the possible comparative advantage small banks may have in forging relationships.",1907.txt,we cannot reject the hypothesis that the coefficients on the first two small bank market share variables are equal to each other.
